        The two of you are smitten with each other. You while away the night whispering sweet nothings. You fall asleep and later awake to the smell of bacon. You see Joyce wearing an apron with a knife in her hand. You sit down at the table. You soon realize that your mother, father, and dog are all dead. Joyce turns to you with a crazed look in her eye. "I'm so glad we can spend the rest of our lives together. Just the two of us!"<br>GOOD END<br><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><br>
