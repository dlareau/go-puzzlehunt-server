        You go home in a panic. You check your mail, but find it full of <a href="letters">letters from Joyce</a>. You burn them, but more fly in through the windows. Soon, the letters are knee-high. You run outside... straight into a spaceship. You see some aliens and pass out from the shock of it all. When you wake up, you are on a new planet. You are informed that a baby alien parasite was extracted from your left ventricle. You live out the rest of your life with your new alien child, never seeing your family again.<br>TRUE END<br><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><img src="spork.jpg"><br>
